## Neural Networks: Zero to Hero Intro (for non-technical people)

<p>This is going to be a constantly evolving set of lecture notes and guides for non-technical people who want to learn about artificial intelligence, neural networks, and machine learning. 
I will primarily be reviewing Andrej Karpathy's Zero to Hero lectures, starting with Mircograd. I may not do these completely in order (building your own GPT might come before Makemore because of interest + demand),
but I will cover all of these. These notes will usually go deeper into the technical and mathematical reasoning behind what is covered in the lectures, primarily for people who are not techncial.
If you are somewhat technical, these notes are probably not for you (though feel free to use them as a supplement).
</p>
<p> The notes are roughly organized as follows. Each video will have its own dedicated code section, with in-depth comments, and a markdown file with in-depth explanations of the concepts. It is recommended to follow those first, before diving into the code.</p>

<p> If you are uncomfortable with code, note that you do not need to follow along with that to get the most out of this guide. Feel free to simply read instead of attempting to reproduce right away.
As of right now, the plan is to include the GPT video, followed by the Makemore series concatanated into one file. </p>
